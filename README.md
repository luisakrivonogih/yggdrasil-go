# Yggdrasil

[![Build status](https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Introduction

Yggdrasil is an early-stage implementation of a fully end-to-end encrypted IPv6
network. It is lightweight, self-arranging, supported on multiple platforms and
allows pretty much any IPv6-capable application to communicate securely with
other Yggdrasil nodes. Yggdrasil does not require you to have IPv6 Internet
connectivity - it also works over IPv4.

## Garlic Routing Overlay (experimental, this branch)

This branch adds an experimental, optional privacy-enhanced routing layer on
top of Yggdrasil: onion/garlic-style circuits, capability negotiation,
per-hop packet-size and timing randomization, gossip-based peer discovery,
topologically diverse hop selection, multipath circuits, and cover-traffic
bundling. It is fully backward compatible - a node with `Garlic.Enabled:
false` (the default) behaves exactly like vanilla Yggdrasil, and ordinary
Yggdrasil nodes transparently carry Garlic traffic without needing to know
it exists or upgrading anything.

Start here:

- [docs/garlic-architecture.md](docs/garlic-architecture.md) - design and integration rationale
- [docs/garlic-protocol.md](docs/garlic-protocol.md) - wire format, what's actually implemented
- [docs/garlic-threat-model.md](docs/garlic-threat-model.md) - what this does and does not protect against (read before relying on it for anything)
- [docs/garlic-security.md](docs/garlic-security.md) - self-review of the implementation
- [docs/garlic-compatibility.md](docs/garlic-compatibility.md) - why old and new nodes keep interoperating
- [docs/garlic-testing.md](docs/garlic-testing.md) - manual walkthrough via `yggdrasilctl`

### Quick install for testing

To build, package, install, and enable Garlic on a Linux server in one
step (auto-detects Debian/Ubuntu-family `apt`/`.deb` vs Fedora/RHEL/CentOS-family
`dnf`/`yum`/`.rpm`):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luisakrivonogih/yggdrasil-go/develop/install.sh | sudo sh
```

This builds an actual `.deb` or `.rpm` from source, installs it the same
way the official packages install (systemd service,
`/etc/yggdrasil/yggdrasil.conf`), sets `Garlic.Enabled: true` in the
generated config, restarts the service, and prints the resulting Garlic
identity and stats so you can confirm it actually started. See
[install.sh](install.sh) for the environment variables it honors
(`REPO_URL`, `REPO_BRANCH`, `WORKDIR`, `ENABLE_GARLIC`), and
[docs/garlic-testing.md](docs/garlic-testing.md) for how to build a circuit
and send traffic through it once the service is running.

## Supported Platforms

Yggdrasil works on a number of platforms, including Linux, macOS, Ubiquiti
EdgeRouter, VyOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and OpenWrt.

Please see our [Installation](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/installation.html)
page for more information. You may also find other platform-specific wrappers, scripts
or tools in the `contrib` folder.

## Building

If you want to build from source, as opposed to installing one of the pre-built
packages:

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org) (requires Go 1.22 or later)
2. Clone this repository
2. Run `./build`

Note that you can cross-compile for other platforms and architectures by
specifying the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables, e.g. `GOOS=windows
./build` or `GOOS=linux GOARCH=mipsle ./build`.

## Running

### Generate configuration

To generate static configuration, either generate a HJSON file (human-friendly,
complete with comments):

```
./yggdrasil -genconf > /path/to/yggdrasil.conf
```

... or generate a plain JSON file (which is easy to manipulate
programmatically):

```
./yggdrasil -genconf -json > /path/to/yggdrasil.conf
```

You will need to edit the `yggdrasil.conf` file to add or remove peers, modify
other configuration such as listen addresses or multicast addresses, etc.

### Run Yggdrasil

To run with the generated static configuration:

```
./yggdrasil -useconffile /path/to/yggdrasil.conf
```

To run in auto-configuration mode (which will use sane defaults and random keys
at each startup, instead of using a static configuration file):

```
./yggdrasil -autoconf
```

You will likely need to run Yggdrasil as a privileged user or under `sudo`,
unless you have permission to create TUN/TAP adapters. On Linux this can be done
by giving the Yggdrasil binary the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability.
