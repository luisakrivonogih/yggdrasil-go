// Rendezvous abstraction (Phase 9 of the roadmap, extended by Part 3 of
// the crypto hardening pass): endpoint discovery decoupled from circuit
// construction. A Rendezvous implementation is untrusted storage/relay
// - it can withhold, reorder, or serve a stale descriptor, but every
// descriptor it hands back is independently verified by the caller
// (VerifyServiceDescriptor, descriptor.go) before its IntroPoints are
// trusted. A DHT-backed implementation is future work behind the same
// interface.
